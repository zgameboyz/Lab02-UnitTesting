## Bank Testing

Today we made a program to create a simple faux banking account app. This app will allow a user to view their balance, deposit and withdraw money. 
The user will be presented with a nice menu to go through each banking option. Ideally there will be more test cases to run through using xunit testing.

We both worked very hard on this program.

In order to run the app simply press the run button after getting all of the code on Visual studio.
